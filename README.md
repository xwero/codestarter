# Codestarter

**ALPHA STAGE**

A framework-agnostic configurable and extendable code file bootstrapper.

## Introduction

The framework make commands are tied to a default file structure. 
And current development practices like a modular monolith and domain driven design dicate another file structure.

That is why this tool is created.

## Installation

```
composer require xwero/codestarter
```
